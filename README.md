# Bank-Term-Deposit-Predictions-Decision Tree-classifier-

## Data Description
- The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

## Problem Description:
- You will be given a dataset for Bank clients, The Database contains examples with the structural information directly relates clients like (Age, Job, Marital, Education, etc.) to predict if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
- Hint: use the most related attributes that will affect the prediction result. (see dataset description)

- For this assignment you are being asked to apply the Decision Tree classifier to correctly access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. A term deposit based on a set of 5 features.

- The class label is y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes', 'no')

## Requirements:
- The interface should enable user to select the percentage of the data needed to be read from the input file e.g. if the file contains 100 records, and the user needs to read 70% of the file then the classification should be done on 70 records only.
- Apply the Decision Tree classifier, to build classifier model from the first set “Training set”.
